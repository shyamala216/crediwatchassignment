# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

   #roles = %w[user manager admin]

   #roles.each do |role|
#     Role.create(name: role)
 #  end

  # departments = ['HR','Engineering','Marketing']

  # deaprtments.each do |department|
   #  Department.create(name: department)
  # end


  # Employee.create(name: 'John Doe', department: Department.first, role: Role.first)
  # Employee.create(name: 'John Smith', department: Department.second, role: Role.second)
  # Employee.create(name: 'Bob Johnson', department: Department.third, role: Role.first)
